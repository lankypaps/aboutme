I live in London, and was born and raised in the UK. I like tormenting myself by trying to learn new (sometimes difficult) things. In the last few years this has been everything about wine, financial markets and retail investing, and most recently software development. 

My first job out of university was personal training, and I've tried many sports over the years, including football, hockey, rugby, cycling, cricket, track & field, and most recently boxing (my amateur record is 0-0-1. I no longer box, funnily enough). Endurance sports are my first love and I still run every week. 

I've worked in startups since 2021, mostly in sales.

## What I'm doing 

New business sales @ [Ravio](http://ravio.com) [Series A in 2025, led by Spark Capital]
- Ravio is an HRtech company that extracts salary data from HR systems via APIs and then aggregates them into benchmarks and other insights
- I joined at seed stage [led by Northzone] and expanded the UK&I market. I signed our first FTSE100 company [Rightmove](http://rightmove.com) and other anchor logos like Zoopla, Wise, Clearbank and Incubeta
- More recently I've been focused on expanding new markets that have little existing compensation data. I ran the campaign to launch Switzerland in 2025 - Ravio is now the best source of real-time salary data in the market

## What I've done before

New business sales @ [LoyaltyLion](http://loyaltylion.com)
- LoyaltyLion is a martech platform for deploying loyalty programs to Shopify sites
- I joined just after Series A at the beginning of 2021 as an SDR, where I learnt the foundations of SaaS and how to do inside sales
- I finished my time there as an Account Executive, having sold the largest outbound deal in the company's history

## Where I studied 

The University of Edinburgh - *MA[Hons] Psychology*
- Four-year undergraduate degree
- Minor in Philosophy 
- Touched on all aspects of psychology, including quantitative research methods and statistics, where I was introduced to and subsequently tormented by R[](https://www.r-project.org/)
- If you ask me what the best thing I learnt was at Edinburgh, I'd tell you "Scepticism". I always default to questioning statements and finding supporting data before accepting a proposition. This sometimes means it takes me a little longer than others to come back with an answer, but it will be a defensible one.

## Stuff I'm currently interested in 

- Continuing to torture myself with statistics and data by learning SQL and Python 
- Eventually running a marathon [and not breaking my foot like I did in 2025]
- Becoming a smarter retail investor
- Buying a house
- You can find a longer list of things I find cool/ have recently consumed with my eyes/ears/mouth [here](https://github.com/lankypaps/aboutme/blob/main/_posts/stuff_im_consuming.md)
